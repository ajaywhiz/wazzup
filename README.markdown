#Wazzup!
A location based service exploiting HTML5 features and javascript

##How it works
As you open the application say in a browser it asks whether you want to share your location? once to grant access application gets your lat,lang coordinates. So, once the application has your coordinates it can server you with any kind of information around you e.g. nearby restaurants, entertainment, news, events etc. 

##Whats working 
To begin with i have just shown the geocoded tweets. Twitter has started geocoding your tweets!! 

##Whats next
Looking for contributors how can add 3rd party services to show or suggest such services e.g. MeetUp, 4Square etc.
