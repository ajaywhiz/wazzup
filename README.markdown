#Wazzup!
A location based service which tells you the latest news, events and other activities happening near you. Purely based on HTML5 and javascript.

##How it works
As you open the application in a browser, it asks to share your location. Once you share your location, application gets your lat,lang coordinates. Afte the appliation has your coordinates, it can serve you with happenings around you e.g. nearby restaurants, entertainment, news, events etc. 

##Whats working 
To begin with I have just shown the geocoded tweets. 

##Whats next
Looking for contributors how can add 3rd party services to show or suggest such services e.g. MeetUp, 4Square etc.
